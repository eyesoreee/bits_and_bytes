### HTTP OPERATIONS

##### GET

Examples include the category in the header and the product cards, with the data originating from the database.

##### POST

I have not implemented this in the frontend as I don't currently have the UI for it. However, Thunder Client demonstrates that I can create new categories, implying that I can also create other models like products and manufacturers.

##### PUT

Similar to POST operations, I only have examples using Thunder Client.

##### DELETE

I didn't create any controllers or routes for this, as I don't necessarily need them, and you also mentioned that you prefer "soft" deleting over permanent deletion.

NOTE:
"Manufacturer" refers to "brand". I just didn't have the energy to go back and change all the "manufacturer" instances to "brand."
